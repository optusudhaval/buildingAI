# 2022-S1-OptusAIB

Welcome to the OptusU Building AI Github repository.

We will be using this repository for hands-on development and collaboration of all AIB modules. As you would now be having your own account on Github, use this to access the resources required to work through your sessions.

## Folder structure of the repository
* notebooks - contains the notebooks designed for each module of the course
* showcases - share examples experimented on

## Keeping up to date 

Each module when released will be available in its own folder on the [this repository](https://github.com/CDAC-lab/2022-S1-OptusAIB). You can subscribe to be informed of new changes on the repository by [watching the repository](https://github.com/CDAC-lab/2022-S1-OptusAIB/subscription)

## Some housekeeping rules
1. Suggestions to improve the content are always welcome as are any experiments that you have tried on your own.
2. Please ensure that if you are contributing to the repository branch the code out as mentioned in pre-course work and submit a pull request. Do not submit directly to the master branch.
3. Always make use of descriptive comments when checking in, so that people viewing the history will know what was commited. Some guidelines can be found in [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
4. Make use of the showcases folder to contribute any experiments with the rest of the class.
